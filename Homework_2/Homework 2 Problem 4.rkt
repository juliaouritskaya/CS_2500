;; Problem 4

;; Consider the following data definitions (we have deliberately omitted the
;; full data design):

;; A Utility is one of:
;; - "Water"
;; - "Electricity"
;; - "Gas"
;; Interpretation: Represents a kind of utility that a home may receive.

;; A UtilityCompany is one of:
;; - "Eversource"
;; - "National Grid"
;; - "Municipal"
;; Interpretation: Represents a utility company that may provide a utility.

;; Part A

;; What is the most appropriate signature of the following function?

(define (F-4-A x y)
  (cond
    [(and (string=? x "Electricity") (string=? y "National Grid")) #true]
    [(string=? y "Eversource") #true]
    [else #false]))

;; [TODO] Signature

;; F-4-A : Utility UtilityCompany -> Boolean
;; Determines if you are using National Grid for electricity or Eversource in general.

;; Part B

;; Write a check-expect where F-4-A produces #false.

(check-expect (F-4-A "Water" "Municipal") #false)
