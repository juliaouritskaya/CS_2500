;; Problem 1

;; Consider the following data definition:

;; A ListofString (LoS) is one of:
;; - '()
;; - (cons String LoS)
;; Interpretation: A list of strings.

(define EX-LOS-1 '())
(define EX-LOS-2 (cons "susie"
                       (cons "robert baratheon"
                             (cons "alice" EX-LOS-1))))
(define EX-LOS-3 (cons "bob" EX-LOS-2))

;; los-template: LoS -> ?
(define (los-template los)
  (...
   (cond
     [(empty? los) ...]
     [(cons? los) (... (first los) ...
                       (los-template (rest los)) ...)])))

;; Part A

;; Design a predicate called contains-three-letter-string? that consumes an LoS 
;; and determines if it contains a string that is exactly three letters long.

;; [TODO] Function design

;; contains-three-letter-string? : ListofString -> Boolean
;; Determines if an LoS contains a string that is exactly three letters long.

    [(cons? los)
     (or
      (= (string-length (first los)) 3)
      (contains-three-letter-string? (rest los)))]))

;; Part B

;; Design a function called hello-list that consumes an LoS and produces a new
;; LoS. The produced LoS prefixes every string in the consumed LoS with 
;; "Hello, ".

;; [TODO] Function design

;; hello-list : ListofString -> ListofString
;; Produces a LoS that prefixes every string in the consumed LoS with "Hello, ".
