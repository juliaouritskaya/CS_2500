;; Problem 2

;; NOTE #1: You may use list abstractions if you wish. However,
;; they are not mandatory.

;; NOTE #2: The "2+ check-expects and no halloween colors" rule
;; applies.

;; NOTE #3: You *may not* use the builtin function replicate to solve this
;; problem.

;; Design a function that receives a number N and a list of strings, and
;; produces a list of strings where each output string is the corresponding
;; input string repeated N times.

;; [TODO] Function design *without using replicate*

;; repeat-all : Nat [Listof String] -> [Listof String]
;; Produces a list of strings where each output string is the
;; corresponding input string repeated the given amount of times.
