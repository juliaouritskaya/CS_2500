;; A Student is a (make-student String Number)
;; Interpretation: (make-student name nuid) represents a student.

;; NOTE: The list produced by students->student-grades should have an item for
;; every student in the input list, even if there are no grades for that 
;; student.

;; students->student-grades : [Listof Students] [Listof Grades] -> [Listof StudentGrades]
